This is the first polynomial that i coded, its cool 
side = 6 since it is a hexagonal, then angles are 360/ 6
then we are running the loop, 500 times probably where we are drawing the side of length that we defined earlier ( see the code) and make sure that the angles are proper and move right in that angle.
look at the code you'll understand it in a minute.. also the length is expanding each time we loop , which makes it a beautifull hypnotic pattern.
