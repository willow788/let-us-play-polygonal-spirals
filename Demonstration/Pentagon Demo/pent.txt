this is the final one, the pentagon
has the same code, almost just the side is changed 
i did change the side in the circle code and run it then screenshoted the output not because i'm lazy , because i need to go the washroon and i wanted to finish the task before i go.

so this is it for this repo 
you can explore more polygon by changing the side variable
also change the length -= length this will make the sides shrink 
for this code's explanation. i highly doubt that you need it, if you do.. check out the hexagon code explanation

now copilot will do the documentation and make this repository prensentable

thats a wrap!, for this repo only , probably!

bye!
