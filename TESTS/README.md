# 🧪 Testing Art Patterns

This repo’s best “test” is visual!

- Run `python main.py` in any code folder.
- Patterns should appear smoothly, matching expected polygon and color.
- No exceptions should be thrown on default Python installs.

If you add new code:
- Confirm it runs and makes a spiral without errors.
- Consider including a screenshot in your PR or Issue for clarity.

--- 
For future expansion:
- A test script can be added to auto-check that scripts import, launch, and complete without failure.
