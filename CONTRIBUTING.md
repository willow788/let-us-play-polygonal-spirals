# 🛠️ Contributing to Let Us Play Polygonal Spirals

Contributions are enthusiastically welcome! Whether you improve code, fix typos, add patterns, or suggest ideas—thank you!

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** and clone the repo.
2. **Work** in a new branch (`git checkout -b my-feature`).
3. **Edit or add code**. Be sure code is readable and, if new, briefly described at the top of your script.
4. **Test** by running the relevant `main.py`—see beautiful spirals!
5. **Commit** with a clear message.

## Guidelines

- Use informative variable names.
- When adding a new polygonal spiral, copy an existing `main.py` and clearly comment on the new math or look.
- Feel free to propose changes to documentation or add screenshots to the README.

## Submitting Issues

- Open an Issue for bugs, feature requests, or ideas.
- Be as specific as possible, and share screenshots if relevant!
